# Issue 321 investigation (in progress)

Base revision: `febf9c7c` (clean checkout). Local changes add only the
failure injection and observation tests; no repair was applied. The SQL test
uses a local pgwire gateway and a SlateDB shard backed by LocalFileSystem.

The injection rejects the first batch containing a view-output key, after the
base transaction batch succeeds. With a compiled projection over `t`, COMMIT
returned `CommandComplete(1)`, and the frontier advanced from 1 to 2. The
table contained `[(1, 10), (2, 20)]`, while the view contained `[(1, 10)]`.
After reopening the shard and compiled view, the same discrepancy remained.
After inserting `(3, 30)`, the table contained `[(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30)]`
and the view contained `[(1, 10), (3, 30)]`. The regression deliberately
fails on this observation. The fault was injected before any production repair.

The direct gRPC closed-inlet observation received exactly one ACK with fields
`(exchange_id, src_shard, target_shard, epoch, seq, credit_grant) =
(100, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2)` and then end-of-stream. Healthy direct delivery and the
existing filesystem-backed committed-frontier replay test passed. These do
not establish recovery of a rejected frame by an owning epoch. A repository
search found `WorkerStreamMultiplexer::send_frame` callers in tests,
simulations and benchmarks, but no production caller; the owning recovery
observation remains inconclusive.

Management authentication remains owned by open issue #303. No authenticated
release-process path was qualified in this investigation.
